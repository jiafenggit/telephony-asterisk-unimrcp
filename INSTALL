BUILD REQUIREMENTS
==================

In order to build the UniMRCP modules for Asterisk, both the UniMRCP and Asterisk projects must be
installed first.

1. Asterisk

Asterisk is an open source communication platform which can be used as a PBX, an IVR, or a conference
bridge.

Project website:
	http://www.asterisk.org

Compatible versions:
	Asterisk 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 10, 11

2. UniMRCP

UniMRCP is an open source project compliant with the IETF RFC6787 (MRCPv2) and RFC4463 (MRCPv1)
specifications.

Project website:
	http://www.unimrcp.org

Compatible versions:
	UniMRCP 1.0.0 and above


GNU BUILD
=========

Prerequisites:

	autoconf 2.59 or newer
	automake
	libtool 1.4 or newer
	gcc
	pkg-config

Procedure:

If the source is checked out from the repository, the "bootstrap" script must be ran first
in order to generate the "configure" script and other required files.

	./bootstrap

The usual "configure", "make", "make install" sequence of commands should follow in order to build
and install the modules from source.

	./configure
	make
	make install

As a result, the modules res_speech_unimrcp.so and app_unimrcp.so will be installed in the modules
directory of Asterisk such as /usr/lib/asterisk/modules by default. Similarly, the configuration
files res-speech-unimrcp.conf and mrcp.conf will be placed in /etc/asterisk.

Configure options:

To explicitly specify where to look for Asterisk, use the option "--with-asterisk=". For example,
if Asterisk is installed in /usr/local/asterisk-11, use:

	./configure --with-asterisk=/usr/local/asterisk-11

To explicitly specify where the Asterisk configuration files are located, use the option
"--with-asterisk-conf". For example:

	./configure --with-asterisk-conf=/usr/local/asterisk/conf

To explicitly specify the Asterisk version, use the option "--with-asterisk-version=". For example:

	./configure --with-asterisk-version=11.2.1

To explicitly specify where to look for UniMRCP, use the option "--with-unimrcp=". For example,
if UniMRCP is installed in /usr/local/unimrcp-1.1, use:

	./configure --with-unimrcp=/usr/local/unimrcp-1.1

To exclude the module res_speech_unimrcp.so from build, use:

	./configure --disable-res-speech-unimrcp

To exclude the module app_unimrcp.so from build, use:

	./configure --disable-app-unimrcp
