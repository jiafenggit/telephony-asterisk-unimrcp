Changes for Asterisk UniMRCP Modules 1.0.0

1. Generic Speech Recognition API (res_speech_unimrcp.so)

  * Handled change to the apt_log_file_open() function. Thanks J.W.F. Thirion.
  * Added the ability to implicitly stop an in-progress recognition request. Applied a reworked patch submitted to Issue-105. Thanks Borja.
  * Added support for loading and activating multiple grammars for a recognition request. Applied a reworked patch submitted to Issue-105. Thanks Borja.
  * Enhanced parsing of NLSML results. Applied a patch submitted to Issue-105. Thanks Borja.
  * Fixed support for built-in grammars. Thanks Renato.

2. Dialplan Applications (app_unimrcp.so)

  2.1. MRCPSynth()

    * Fixed a DTMF generator issue. Thanks J.W.F. Thirion.
    * Added the ability to load a plain text or an SSML content from the specified file. Applied a reworked patch submitted to Issue-151. Thanks Borja.

  2.2. MRCPRecog()

    * Fixed a misspelled name of the 'Input-Waveform-URI' header field.
    * Use the 'sl' option for the 'Sensitivity-Level' header field and 'spl' for 'Speech-Language'.
    * Fixed a crash in speech_channel_destroy(). Thanks Evan, Stephen, and Rodolfo.
    * Fixed a memory leak in processing of recognition results. A recognition result is now allocated from the channel memory pool using apr_pstrdup(). Otherwise, the duplicated string should have been explicitly freed.
    * Fixed the grammar type detection routine.
    * Added the ability to load a prompt and/or a grammar from the specified files.
    * Added support for loading and activating multiple grammars for a recognition request. The grammars can be specified as a comma-separated list of input parameters.
    * Added a new application option: exit-on-play-error "epe". If the option is enabled and the specified prompt file cannot be played, the application exits with the "RECOGSTATUS" variable set to "ERROR".

  2.3. SynthAndRecog()

    This is a new diaplan application which plays a synthesized prompt to the user and waits for speech to be recognized. The application supports the following features:

    * Plain text and SSML prompts.
    * Inline (SRGS XML, SRGS ABNF, JSGF), built-in, and URI grammars. Inline grammars can be loaded from a file. A list of comma-separated grammars can be used for a recognition request.
    * Barge-in, and an option for non-bargeinable prompts.
    * Recognition timers.
    * Recognition results.

3. Miscellaneous

  * Enhanced the version detection routine of Asterisk (asterisk.m4).
  * Added a new optional parameter to the configure script --with-asterisk-version, which allows to explicitly specify a version string in case the version cannot be determined or retrieved implicitly.
  * Included asterisk.m4 from acinclude.m4.
  * Added a new header file ast_compat_def.h, which provides backward compatible macros, definitions, and utility functions for Asterisk.
  * Added support for Asterisk 1.8, 10, and 11 to the modules res_speech-unimrcp and app_unimrcp. The former versions are also supported.
  * Added support for auto-generated XML doc files introduced since Asterisk 1.6. The XML doc files are generated from the corresponding tags declared in source files.
  * Split the module app_unimrcp into several integral parts. The source file app_unimrcp.c is now the entry point of the module, and the applications reside in separate source files.
  * Fixed loading of the configuration parameter "offer-new-connection" to accept both boolean "true" or "false" and integer "1" or "0" values.
  * Added a checking for pkg-config to the configure script.
  * Added a new sample dialplan applications file mrcp_sample_apps.conf which provides numerous usage examples. Removed the old file say-digit.conf.
  * For logging purposes, set the name of a UniMRCP session object to schannel->name.
  * Using transparent header fields to apply application options.
  * Retained backward compatibility with UniMRCP 1.0.0 and above, but dropped the support for earlier versions.
  * Updated the README file to include the statement for the GPLv2 license. Added the INSTALL and COPYING files.
