INTRODUCTION
============
This is a connector bridge for Asterisk and UniMRCP.
Currently it contains the implementation of Asterisk's Speech API
via UniMRCP.


INSTALLATION
============

- Prerequisites
Both Asterisk (>=1.6.x) and UniMRCP (>0.8.0, at least r1306) must be installed first.
http://www.asterisk.org/
http://www.unimrcp.org/

- Procedure
Now, when all the prerequisites are in place, 
the connector bridge can be installed next as follows
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

As a result res_speech_unimrcp.so will be installed in /usr/lib/asterisk/modules directory and will be loaded with Asterisk.
No you can reuse your existing applications, which are based on Asterisk's Speech API or start implementing new once.
A sample Asterisk's dialplan application can be found in conf subdir
