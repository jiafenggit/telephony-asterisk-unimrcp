INTRODUCTION
============

This is the connector bridge for Asterisk and UniMRCP.
Currently it includes the implementation of Asterisk's 
Generic Speech API via UniMRCP.


INSTALLATION
============

- Prerequisites

Both Asterisk (>=1.6.x) and UniMRCP (>0.8.0, at least r1306) must be installed first.


- Procedure

Now, when all the prerequisites are in place, 
the connector bridge can be installed next as follows

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

As a result, the module res_speech_unimrcp.so will be installed in 
/usr/lib/asterisk/modules directory.

To load the module into running Asterisk use
$ cd res-speech-unimrcp
$ make load

To unload the module use
$ cd res-speech-unimrcp
$ make unload


CONFIGURATION
=============

Now you may start developing or just continue using speech applications via 
Asterisk's dialplan, AGI and everything else based on Asterisk's Generic Speech API.

A sample dialplan application can be found in conf subdir.

To make this work end to end you should have an MRCPv2 or MRCPv1 compliant server 
up and running. See the Interoperability Guide for MRCP servers UniMRCP
client is known to work with.

See the Configuration Guide on how to configure UniMRCP client.
